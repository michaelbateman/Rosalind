#Given: A permutation of at most 12 symbols defining an ordered alphabet A and a positive integer n (n<=4).

#Return: All strings of length at most n formed from A, ordered lexicographically. (Note: As in “Enumerating k-mers Lexicographically”, alphabet order is based on the order in which the symbols are given.)
